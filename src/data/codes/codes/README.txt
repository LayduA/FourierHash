This archive contains codeword files and orbit representatives files for the 
permutation codes found in the paper:

A new table of permutation codes.

by D.H. Smith and R.Montemanni.

When the code is constructed using an automorphism group the orbit representatives in
the "REPSwithGROUP" file ("orbit representatives with group")are preceded by a description 
of the group and its permutation generators (as permutations on the elements 
{0,1,2,...,n-1}). These are derived from the permutation generators given by Magma 
(where permutations in Magma are permutations on  {1,2,3,...,n}. This change has been made 
so that the codewords are in the same form as those generated by the "clique building" software.

It should be noted that for the codes accompanied by a CYC file (using a cycle (0 1 2 3 ... n-1)) 
the cycle is actually a cycle on the positions from 0 to n-1 rather than a cyclic permutation on 
the elements. This was done for efficiency reasons. Similarly, for the codes accompanied by an 
EXCYC file using a cycle (1 2 3 ... n-1)) the cycle is actually a cycle on the positions from 
1 to (n-1) rather than a cyclic permutation on n-1 elements.
