# Beware, ye who enter here
This repo contains the code for Fourier Hash, as visual hashing scheme that I designed for my master's thesis. However, at the time I didn't take the time to organise my things properly, resulting in the absolute mess you can find here.

Feel free to explore this mountain of spaghetti if you want, but I make no promise that you will be able to make it work
